### Known Bugs

* [ ]  #3 : Text field for meal name entry doesn't resize to fill available space.
* [ ] #16 : The root stack view's vertical constraint is incorrect, resulting in
 awkward layouts with screen sizes different from the iPhone 7. 


### Notes
* N/A

### Impressions
* Very excited to be diving a bit more into Swift! I'm enjoying working with 
 Xcode, and especially using drag-and-drop to connect outlets, I'm curious to 
 learn more about how it manages communication across objects.
