* [Start Developing iOS Apps (Swift) | Apple](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH2-SW1)

* [ ] #16 : The root stack view's vertical constraint is incorrect, resulting in
 awkward layouts with screen sizes different from the iPhone 7.

### Impressions
* Very excited to be diving a bit more into Swift! I'm enjoying working with 
 Xcode, and especially using drag-and-drop to connect outlets, I'm curious to 
 learn more about how it manages communication across objects. Looking forward
 to furthering work on this project over the next couple weeks!
